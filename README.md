Quick access and manange text notes from vim/neovim and cli.

# About
This small utility allows you to quickly search and change textual files by the
help of `fzf` and `rg` commands. It has almost the same interface to vim/neovim
and command line prompt making the user experience nicer with less context
switching gets involved.
